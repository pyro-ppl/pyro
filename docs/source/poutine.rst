Poutine (Effect handlers)
==========================

Beneath the built-in inference algorithms, Pyro has a library of composable
effect handlers for creating new inference algorithms and working with probabilistic
programs. Pyro's inference algorithms are all built by applying these handlers to stochastic functions.
