class BlockMessenger(Messenger):
    """
    This Messenger selectively hides pyro primitive sites from the outside world.
    Default behavior: block everything
    BlockMessenger has a flexible interface that allows users
    to specify in several different ways
    which sites should be hidden or exposed.

    A site is hidden if at least one of the following holds:

        1. msg["name"] in hide
        2. msg["type"] in hide_types
        3. msg["name"] not in expose and msg["type"] not in expose_types
        4. hide_all == True and hide, hide_types, and expose_types are all None


    For example, suppose the stochastic function fn has two sample sites "a" and "b".
    Then any poutine outside of BlockMessenger(fn, hide=["a"])
    will not be applied to site "a" and will only see site "b":

    >>> fn_inner = TraceMessenger()(fn)
    >>> fn_outer = TraceMessenger()(BlockMessenger(hide=["a"])(TraceMessenger()(fn)))
    >>> trace_inner = fn_inner.get_trace()
    >>> trace_outer  = fn_outer.get_trace()
    >>> "a" in trace_inner
    True
    >>> "a" in trace_outer
    False
    >>> "b" in trace_inner
    True
    >>> "b" in trace_outer
    True

    See the constructor for details.
