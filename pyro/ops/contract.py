    """
    Generalized batched sum-product algorithm via tensor message passing.

    This generalizes :func:`~pyro.ops.einsum.contract` in two ways:

    1.  Multiple outputs are allowed, and intermediate results can be shared.
    2.  Inputs and outputs can be batched along symbols given in ``batch_dims``;
        reductions along ``batch_dims`` are product reductions.

    The best way to understand this function is to try the examples below,
    which show how :func:`ubersum` calls can be implemented as multiple calls
    to :func:`~pyro.ops.einsum.contract` (which is generally more expensive).

    To illustrate multiple outputs, note that the following are equivalent::

        z1, z2, z3 = ubersum('ab,bc->a,b,c', x, y)  # multiple outputs

        backend = 'pyro.ops.einsum.torch_log'
        z1 = contract('ab,bc->a', x, y, backend=backend)
        z2 = contract('ab,bc->b', x, y, backend=backend)
        z3 = contract('ab,bc->c', x, y, backend=backend)

    To illustrate batched inputs, note that the following are equivalent::

        assert len(x) == 3 and len(y) == 3
        z = ubersum('c,abc,acd->bd', w, x, y, batch_dims='a')

        z = contract('c,bc,bc,bc,cd,cd,cd->bd', w, *x, *y, backend=backend)

    When a non-batch dimension `i` always appears with a batch dimension `a`,
    then `i` corresponds to a distinct symbol for each slice of `a`. Thus
    the following are equivalent::

        assert len(x) == 3 and len(y) == 3
        z = ubersum('abi,abi->', x, y, batch_dims='a')

        z = contract('bi,bj,bk,bi,bj,bk->', *x, *y, backend=backend)

    When such a non-batched dimension appears in the output, it must be
    accompanied by all of its batch dimensions, e.g. the following are
    equivalent::

        assert len(x) == 3 and len(y) == 3
        z = ubersum('abi,abi->ai', x, y, batch_dims='a')

        z0 = contract('bi,bj,bk,bi,bj,bk->i', *x, *y, backend=backend)
        z1 = contract('bi,bj,bk,bi,bj,bk->j', *x, *y, backend=backend)
        z2 = contract('bi,bj,bk,bi,bj,bk->k', *x, *y, backend=backend)
        z = torch.stack([z0, z1, z2])

    Among all valid inputs, some computations are polynomial in the sizes of
    the input tensors and other computations are exponential in the sizes of
    the input tensors. This function raises :py:class:`NotImplementedError`
    whenever the computation is exponential.
