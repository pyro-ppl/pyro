def ubersum(equation, *operands, **kwargs):
    """
    Generalized batched sum-product algorithm via tensor message passing.

    This generalizes :func:`~pyro.ops.einsum.contract` in two ways:

    1.  Multiple outputs are allowed, and intermediate results can be shared.
    2.  Inputs and outputs can be batched along symbols given in ``plates``;
        reductions along ``plates`` are product reductions.

    The best way to understand this function is to try the examples below,
    which show how :func:`ubersum` calls can be implemented as multiple calls
    to :func:`~pyro.ops.einsum.contract` (which is generally more expensive).

    To illustrate multiple outputs, note that the following are equivalent::

        z1, z2, z3 = ubersum('ab,bc->a,b,c', x, y)  # multiple outputs

        backend = 'pyro.ops.einsum.torch_log'
        z1 = contract('ab,bc->a', x, y, backend=backend)
        z2 = contract('ab,bc->b', x, y, backend=backend)
        z3 = contract('ab,bc->c', x, y, backend=backend)

    To illustrate batched inputs, note that the following are equivalent::

        assert len(x) == 3 and len(y) == 3
        z = ubersum('ab,ai,bi->b', w, x, y, plates='i')

        z = contract('ab,a,a,a,b,b,b->b', w, *x, *y, backend=backend)

    When a sum dimension `a` always appears with a batch dimension `i`,
    then `a` corresponds to a distinct symbol for each slice of `a`. Thus
    the following are equivalent::

        assert len(x) == 3 and len(y) == 3
        z = ubersum('ai,ai->', x, y, plates='i')

        z = contract('a,b,c,a,b,c->', *x, *y, backend=backend)

    When such a sum dimension appears in the output, it must be
    accompanied by all of its batch dimensions, e.g. the following are
    equivalent::

        assert len(x) == 3 and len(y) == 3
        z = ubersum('abi,abi->bi', x, y, plates='i')

        z0 = contract('ab,ac,ad,ab,ac,ad->b', *x, *y, backend=backend)
        z1 = contract('ab,ac,ad,ab,ac,ad->c', *x, *y, backend=backend)
        z2 = contract('ab,ac,ad,ab,ac,ad->d', *x, *y, backend=backend)
        z = torch.stack([z0, z1, z2])

    Note that each batch slice through the output is multilinear in all batch
    slices through all inptus, thus e.g. batch matrix multiply would be
    implemented *without* ``plates``, so the following are all equivalent::

        xy = ubersum('abc,acd->abd', x, y, plates='')
        xy = torch.stack([xa.mm(ya) for xa, ya in zip(x, y)])
        xy = torch.bmm(x, y)

    Among all valid equations, some computations are polynomial in the sizes of
    the input tensors and other computations are exponential in the sizes of
    the input tensors. This function raises :py:class:`NotImplementedError`
    whenever the computation is exponential.

    :param str equation: An einsum equation, optionally with multiple outputs.
    :param torch.Tensor operands: A collection of tensors.
    :param str plates: An optional string of plate symbols.
    :param str backend: An optional einsum backend, defaults to
        'pyro.ops.einsum.torch_log'
    :param dict cache: An optional :func:`~opt_einsum.shared_intermediates`

    :param bool modulo_total: Optionally allow ubersum to arbitrarily scale
        each result batch, which can significantly reduce computation. This is
        safe to set whenever each result batch denotes a nonnormalized
        probability distribution whose total is not of interest.
