    Generalizes :class:`SimpleSIRModel` by adding superspreading effects.

    To customize this model we recommend forking and editing this class.

    This model accounts for superspreading (overdispersed individual
    reproductive number) by assuming each infected individual infects
    BetaBinomial-many susceptible individuals, where the BetaBinomial
    distribution acts as an overdispersed Binomial distribution, adapting the
    more standard NegativeBinomial distribution that acts as an overdispersed
    Poisson distribution [1,2] to the setting of finite populations. To
    preserve Markov structure, we follow [2] and assume all infections by a
    single individual occur on the single time step where that individual makes
    an ``I -> R`` transition. That is, whereas the :class:`SimpleSIRModel`
    assumes infected individuals infect `Binomial(S,R/tau)`-many susceptible
    individuals during each infected time step (over `tau`-many steps on
    average), this model assumes they infect `BetaBinomial(k,...,S)`-many
    susceptible individuals but only on the final time step before recovering.

    :class:`~pyro.distributions.CoalescentRateLikelihood` with base coalescence
    rate computed from the ``S`` and ``I`` populations. This likelihood is
    independent across time and preserves the Markov propert needed for

class RegionalSIRModel(CompartmentalModel):
    r"""
    Generalizes :class:`SimpleSIRModel` to simultaneously model multiple
    regions with weak coupling across regions.

    To customize this model we recommend forking and editing this class.

    Regions are coupled by a ``coupling`` matrix with entries in ``[0,1]``.
    The all ones matrix is equivalent to a single region. The identity matrix
    is equivalent to a set of independent regions. This need not be symmetric,
    but symmetric matrices are probably more physically plausible. The expected
    number of new infections each time step ``S2I`` is Binomial distributed
    with mean::

        E[S2I] = S (1 - (1 - R0 / (population @ coupling)) ** (I @ coupling))
               ≈ R0 S (I @ coupling) / (population @ coupling)  # for small I

    Thus in a nearly entirely susceptible population, a single infected
    individual infects approximately ``R0`` new individuals on average,
    independent of ``coupling``.

    This model demonstrates:

    1.  How to create a regional model with a ``population`` vector.
    2.  How to model both homogeneous parameters (here ``R0``) and
        heterogeneous parameters with hierarchical structure (here ``rho``)
        using ``self.region_plate``.
    3.  How to approximately couple regions in :meth:`transition_bwd` using
        ``prev["I_approx"]``.

    :param torch.Tensor population: Tensor of per-region populations, defining
        ``population = S + I + R``.
    :param torch.Tensor coupling: Pairwise coupling matrix. Entries should be
        in ``[0,1]``.
    :param float recovery_time: Mean recovery time (duration in state ``I``).
        Must be greater than 1.
    :param iterable data: Time x Region sized tensor of new observed
        infections. Each time step is vector of Binomials distributed between
        0 and the number of ``S -> I`` transitions. This allows false negative
        but no false positives.
