class Householder(TransformModule):
    """
    Represents multiple applications of the Householder bijective transformation. A single Householder
    transformation takes the form,

        :math:`\\mathbf{y} = (I - 2*\\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}^T}{||\\mathbf{u}||^2})\\mathbf{x}`

    where :math:`\\mathbf{x}` are the inputs, :math:`\\mathbf{y}` are the outputs, and the learnable parameters
    are :math:`\\mathbf{u}\\in\\mathbb{R}^D` for input dimension :math:`D`.

    The transformation represents the reflection of :math:`\\mathbf{x}` through the plane passing through the
    origin with normal :math:`\\mathbf{u}`.

    :math:`D` applications of this transformation are able to transform standard i.i.d. standard Gaussian noise
    into a Gaussian variable with an arbitrary covariance matrix. With :math:`K<D` transformations, one is able
    to approximate a full-rank Gaussian distribution using a linear transformation of rank :math:`K`.

    Together with :class:`~pyro.distributions.TransformedDistribution` this provides a way to create richer
    variational approximations.

    Example usage:

    >>> base_dist = dist.Normal(torch.zeros(10), torch.ones(10))
    >>> transform = Householder(10, count_transforms=5)
    >>> pyro.module("my_transform", p) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> flow_dist = dist.TransformedDistribution(base_dist, [transform])
    >>> flow_dist.sample()  # doctest: +SKIP

                0.1389, -0.4629,  0.0986])
