    Abstract base class for probability distributions.

    Instances can either be constructed from a fixed parameter and called without paramters,

    When calling with a parameter, it is preferred to use one of the singleton instances
    in pyro.distributions rather than constructing a new instance without a parameter.

    Derived classes must implement the `sample`, and `batch_log_pdf` methods.
