    Discrete Cosine reparamterizer, using a
    :class:`~pyro.distributions.transforms.DiscreteCosineTransform` .

    This is useful for sequential models where coupling along a time-like axis
    (e.g. a banded precision matrix) introduces long-range correlation. This
    reparameterizes to a frequency-domain represetation where posterior
    covariance should be closer to diagonal, thereby improving the accuracy of
    diagonal guides in SVI and improving the effectiveness of a diagonal mass
    matrix in HMC.

    When reparameterizing variables that are approximately continuous along the
    time dimension, set ``smooth=1``. For variables that are approximately
    continuously differentiable along the time axis, set ``smooth=2``.

    This reparameterization works only for latent variables, not likelihoods.

    :param int dim: Dimension along which to transform. Must be negative.
        This is an absolute dim counting from the right.
    :param float smooth: Smoothing parameter. When 0, this transforms white
        noise to white noise; when 1 this transforms Brownian noise to to white
        noise; when -1 this transforms violet noise to white noise; etc. Any
        real number is allowed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise.
