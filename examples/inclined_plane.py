"""
Samantha really likes physics---but she likes Pyro even more. Instead of using
calculus to do her physics lab homework (which she could easily do), she's going
to use bayesian inference. The problem setup is as follows. In lab she observed
a little box slide down an inclined plane (length of 2 meters and with an incline of
30 degrees) 20 times. Each time she measured and recorded the descent time. The timing
device she used has a known measurement error of 20 milliseconds. Using the observed
data, she wants to infer the coefficient of friction mu between the box and the inclined
plane. She already has (deterministic) python code that can simulate the amount of time
that it takes the little box to slide down the inclined plane as a function of mu. Using
Pyro, she can reverse the simulator and infer mu from the observed descent times.
