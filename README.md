Pyro is a flexible, scalable deep probabilistic programming library built on PyTorch.  Notably, it was designed with these principles in mind:

- **Universal**: Pyro is a universal PPL - it can represent any computable probability distribution.
- **Scalable**: Pyro scales to large data sets with little overhead compared to hand-written code.
- **Minimal**: Pyro is agile and maintainable. It is implemented with a small core of powerful, composable abstractions.
- **Flexible**: Pyro aims for automation when you want it, control when you need it. This is accomplished through high-level abstractions to express generative and inference models, while allowing experts easy-access to customize inference.

Pyro is in a beta release.  It is developed and maintained by [Uber AI Labs](http://uber.ai) and community contributors.

## Installing

### Installing a stable Pyro release

**Install using pip:**

```sh
pip install pyro-ppl
```

**Install from source:**
```sh
git clone git@github.com:pyro-ppl/pyro.git
cd pyro
git checkout master  # master is pinned to the latest release
pip install .
```

**Install with extra packages:**

To install the dependencies required to run the probabilistic models included in the `examples`/`tutorials` directories, please use the following command:
```sh
pip install pyro-ppl[extras] 
```
Make sure that the models come from the same release version of the [Pyro source code](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/releases) as you have installed.

### Installing Pyro dev branch

For recent features you can install Pyro from source.

**Install using pip:**

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro.git
```

or, with the `extras` dependency to run the probabilistic models included in the `examples`/`tutorials` directories:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro.git#egg=project[extras]
```

**Install from source:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro
cd pyro
pip install .  # pip install .[extras] for running models in examples/tutorials
```

## Running Pyro from a Docker Container
