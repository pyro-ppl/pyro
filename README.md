Pyro is a flexible, scalable deep probabilistic programming library built on PyTorch.  Notably, it was designed with these principles in mind:
- **Universal**: Pyro is a universal PPL -- it can represent any computable probability distribution.
- **Scalable**: Pyro scales to large data sets with little overhead compared to hand-written code.
- **Minimal**: Pyro is agile and maintainable. It is implemented with a small core of powerful, composable abstractions.
- **Flexible**: Pyro aims for automation when you want it, control when you need it. This is accomplished through high-level abstractions to express generative and inference models, while allowing experts easy-access to customize inference.

Pyro is in an alpha release.  It is developed and used by [Uber AI Labs](http://uber.ai).
