    "# The Semi-Supervised VAE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the models we've covered in the tutorials are unsupervised:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)](http://pyro.ai/examples/vae.html)\n",
    "- [the DMM](http://pyro.ai/examples/dmm.html)\n",
    "- [Attend-Infer-Repeat](http://pyro.ai/examples/air.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also covered a simple supervised model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Bayesian Regression](http://pyro.ai/examples/bayesian_regression.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The semi-supervised setting, where some of the data is labeled and some is not, represents an interesting intermediate case. It is also of great practical importance, since we are often faced with the situation where we have large amounts of unlabeled data and precious few labeled datapoints. Being able to leverage the unlabeled data to improve our models of the labeled data is something we'd clearly like to be able to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "The semi-supervised setting is also a problem setting that pairs well with generative models, where missing data can be accounted for quite naturally&mdash;at least conceptually.\n",
    "As we will see, in restricting our attention to semi-supervised generative models, there will be no shortage of different model variants and possible inference strategies. \n",
    "Although we'll only be able to explore a few of these variants in detail, the reader is likely to come away from the tutorial with a greater appreciation for how useful the abstractions and modularity offered by probabilistic programming can be in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's go about building a generative model. We have a dataset \n",
    "$\\mathcal{D}$ of size $N$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{D} = \\{ ({\\bf x}_i, {\\bf y}_i) \\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $\\{ {\\bf x}_i \\}$ are always observed and the labels $\\{ {\\bf y}_i \\}$ are only observed for some subset of the data. Since we want  to be able to model complex variations in the data, we're going to make this a latent variable model with a local latent variable ${\\bf z}_i$ private to each pair $({\\bf x}_i, {\\bf y}_i)$. Even with this set of choices, a number of model variants are possible: we're going to focus on the model variant depicted in Figure 1 (this is model M2 in reference [1]).\n",

    "\n",
    "For convenience&mdash;and since we're going to model MNIST in our experiments below&mdash;let's suppose the $\\{ {\\bf x}_i \\}$ are images and the $\\{ {\\bf y}_i \\}$ are digit labels. In this model setup, the latent random variable ${\\bf z}_i$ and the (partially observed) digit label _jointly_ generate the observed image. \n",
    "Let's sidestep asking when we expect this particular factorization of $({\\bf x}_i, {\\bf y}_i, {\\bf z}_i)$ to be appropriate, since the answer to that question will depend in large part on the dataset in question (among other things). Let's instead highlight some of the ways that inference in this model will be challenging as well as some of the solutions that we'll be exploring in the rest of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The challenges of inference\n",
    "\n",
    "For concreteness we're going to continue to assume that the $\\{ {\\bf y}_i \\}$ are discrete labels; we will also assume that the $\\{ {\\bf z}_i \\}$ are continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we apply the general recipe for stochastic variational inference to our model (e.g. see [SVI Part I](http://pyro.ai/examples/svi_part_i.html)) we're going to be sampling the discrete (and thus non-reparameterizable) variable ${\\bf y}_i$ whenever it's unobserved. As discussed in [SVI Part III](http://pyro.ai/examples/svi_part_i.html) this will generally lead to high-variance gradient estimates. \n",
    "- One way to ameliorate this problem&mdash;and one we'll explore below&mdash;is to forego sampling and instead sum out all ten values of the class label ${\\bf y}_i$ when we calculate the ELBO for an unlabeled datapoint ${\\bf x}_i$. This is somewhat expensive but can help us reduce the variance of our gradient estimator\n",
    "- Recall that the role of the guide is to 'fill in' _latent_ random variables. Concretely, one component of our guide will be of the form $q_\\phi({\\bf y} | {\\bf x})$. Any unlabeled datapoints \n",
    "$\\{ {\\bf x}_i \\}$ will have their corresponding labels $\\{ {\\bf y}_i \\}$ 'filled in' by $q_\\phi(\\cdot | {\\bf x})$. Crucially, this means that the only term in the ELBO that will depend on $q_\\phi(\\cdot | {\\bf x})$ is the term that involves a sum over _unlabeled_ datapoints. This means that our classifier $q_\\phi(\\cdot | {\\bf x})$&mdash;which in many cases will be the primary object of interest&mdash;will not be learning from the labeled datapoints (at least not directly)\n",
    "- This seems like a potential problem. Luckily, various fixes are possible. Below we'll follow the approach in reference [1], which involves introducing an additional loss function for the classifier to ensure that the classifier learns directly from the labeled data\n",

    "\n",
    "As highlighted in the introduction, when the discrete latent labels ${\\bf y}$ are not observed, the ELBO gradient estimates rely on sampling from $q_\\phi({\\bf y}|{\\bf x})$. These gradient estimates can be very high-variance, especially early in the learning process when the guessed labels are often incorrect. A common approach to reduce variance in this case is to sum out discrete latent variables, replacing the Monte Carlo expectation \n",

    "Going beyond the particular model in this tutorial, Pyro supports summing over arbitrarily many discrete latent variables. Beware that the cost of summing is exponential in the number of discrete variables, but is cheap(er) if multiple independent discrete variables are packed into a single tensor (as in this tutorial, where the discrete labels for the entire mini-batch are packed into the single tensor ${\\bf y}$)."

    "Table 1 collects our results from the three variants explored in the tutorial. For comparison, we also show results from a simple classifier baseline, which only makes use of the supervised data (and no latent random variables). Reported are mean accuracies (with 95% confidence bounds in parentheses) across five random selections of supervised data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first note that the results for the third variant&mdash;where we summed out the discrete latent random variable $\\bf y$ and made use of the additional term in the objective function&mdash;reproduce the results reported in reference [1]. This is encouraging, since it means that the abstractions in Pyro proved flexible enough to accomodate the required modeling and inference setup. Significantly, this flexibility was evidently necessary to outperform the baseline. It's also worth emphasizing that the gap between the baseline and third variant of our generative model setup increases as the number of labeled datapoints decreases (maxing out at about 15% for the case with only 100 labeled datapoints). This is a tantalizing result because it's precisely in the regime where we have few labeled data points that semi-supervised learning is particularly attractive.\n",

    "\n",
    "We've seen that generative models offer a natural approach to semi-supervised machine learning. One of the most attractive features of generative models is that we can explore a large variety of models in a single unified setting. In this tutorial we've only been able to explore a small fraction of the possible model and inference setups that are possible. There is no reason to expect that one variant is best; depending on the dataset and application, there will be reason to prefer one over another. And there a lot of variants (see Figure 5)!\n",

    "\n",
    "Some of these variants clearly make more sense than others, but a priori it's difficult to know which ones are worth trying out. This is especially true once we open the door to more complicated setups, like the two models at the bottom of the figure, which include an always latent random variable ${\\bf \\tilde{y}}$ in addition to the partially observed label ${\\bf y}$. (Incidentally, this class of models&mdash;see reference [2] for similar variants&mdash;offers another potential solution to the 'no training' problem that we identified above.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reader probably doesn't need any convincing that a systematic exploration of even a fraction of these options would be incredibly time-consuming and error-prone if each model and each inference procedure were coded up by scratch. It's only with the modularity and abstraction made possible by a probabilistic programming system that we can hope to explore the landscape of generative models with any kind of nimbleness&mdash;and reap any awaiting rewards.\n",
