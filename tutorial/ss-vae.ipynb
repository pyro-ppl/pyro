    "The semi-supervised setting, where some of the data is labeled and some is not, represents an interesting intermediate case. It's also a problem setting that pairs well with generative models, where missing data can be accounted for quite naturally&mdash;at least conceptually.\n",
    "As we will see, in restricting our attention to semi-supervised generative models, there will be no shortage of different model variants and possible inference strategies. \n",
    "Although we'll only be able to explore a few of these variants in detail, the reader is likely to come away from the tutorial with a greater appreciation for how useful the abstractions and modularity offered by probabilistic programming can be in practice.\n",
