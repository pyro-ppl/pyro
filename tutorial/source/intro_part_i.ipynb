As of PyTorch 0.4 and Pyro 0.2, Pyro uses PyTorch's [distribution library](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/distributions.html). You can also create custom distributions using [transforms](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/distributions.html#module-torch.distributions.transforms).\n",

First, in lines 2-3 we use `pyro.sample` to define a binary random variable 'cloudy', which is given by a draw from the bernoulli distribution with a parameter of `0.3`. Since the bernoulli distributions returns `0`s or `1`s, in line 4 we convert the value `cloudy` to a string so that return values of `weather` are easier to parse. So according to this model 30% of the time it's cloudy and 70% of the time it's sunny.\n",

As such, it defines a probabilistic model that we can reason about using the techniques of probability theory. For example we might ask: if I observe a temperature of 70 degrees, how likely is it to be cloudy? How to formulate and answer these kinds of questions will be the subject of the next tutorial.\n",
