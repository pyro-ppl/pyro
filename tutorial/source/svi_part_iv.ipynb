    "Along the way we defined models and guides (i.e. variational distributions),\n",
    "setup variational objectives (in particular [ELBOs](https://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/inference_algos.html?highlight=elbo#module-pyro.infer.elbo)), \n",
    "and constructed optimizers ([pyro.optim](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/optimization.html)). \n",
    "The effect of all this machinery is to cast Bayesian inference as a *stochastic optimization problem*. \n",

    "This is all very useful, but in order to arrive at our ultimate goal—learning model parameters, inferring approximate posteriors, making predictions with the posterior predictive distribution, etc.—we need to successfully solve this optimization problem. \n",

    "### 1. Start with a small learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "While large learning rates might be appropriate for some problems, it's usually good practice to start with small learning rates like $10^{-3}$\n",

    "```python\n",
    "optimizer = pyro.optim.Adam({\"lr\": 0.001})\n",

    "\n",
    "While a moderately large learning rate can be useful at the beginning of optimization when you're far from the optimum and want to take large gradient steps, it's often useful to have a smaller learning rate later on so that you don't bounce around the optimum excessively without converging. \n",

    "### 6. If you are having trouble constructing a custom guide, use an AutoGuide\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for a model/guide pair to lead to stable optimization a number of conditions need to be satisfied, some of which we have covered above. \n",
    "Sometimes it can be difficult to diagnose the reason for numerical instability or poor convergence. \n",
    "Among other reasons this is because the fundamental issue could arise in a number of different places: in the model, in the guide, or in the choice of optimization algorithm or hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the problem is actually in your model even though you think it's in the guide. \n",
    "Conversely, sometimes the problem is in your guide even though you think it's in the model or somewhere else. \n",
    "For these reasons it can be helpful to reduce the number of moving parts while you try to identify the underlying issue.\n",
    "One convenient way to do this is to replace your custom guide with a [pyro.infer.AutoGuide](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/infer.autoguide.html#module-pyro.infer.autoguide). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if all the latent variables in your model are continuous, you can try a [pyro.infer.AutoNormal](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/infer.autoguide.html#autonormal) guide.\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use MAP inference instead of full-blown variational inference. See the [MLE/MAP](http://pyro.ai/examples/mle_map.html) tutorial for further details. Once you have MAP inference working, there's good reason to believe that your model is setup correctly (at least as far as basic numerical stability is concerned). \n",
    "If you're interested in obtaining approximate posterior distributions, you can now follow-up with full-blown SVI. Indeed a natural order of operations might use the following sequence of increasingly flexible autoguides:\n",
    "\n",
    "[AutoDelta](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/infer.autoguide.html#autodelta)   →  [AutoNormal](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/infer.autoguide.html#autonormal)  →  [AutoLowRankMultivariateNormal](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/infer.autoguide.html#autolowrankmultivariatenormal)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find that you want a more flexible guide or that you want to take more control over how exactly the guide is defined, at this juncture you can proceed to build a custom guide. \n",
    "One way to go about doing this is to leverage [easy guides](http://pyro.ai/examples/easyguide.html), which strike a balance between the control of a fully custom guide and the automation of an autoguide.\n",

    "### 7. Parameter initialization matters: initialize guide distributions to have low variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization in optimization problems can make all the difference between finding a good solution and failing catastrophically.\n",
    "It is difficult to come up with a comprehensive set of good practices for initialization, as good initialization schemes are often very problem dependent. \n",
    "In the context of Stochastic Variational Inference it is generally a good idea to initialize your guide distributions so that they have **low variance**. \n",
    "This is because the ELBO gradients you use to optimize the ELBO are stochastic. \n",
    "If the ELBO gradients you get at the beginning of ELBO optimization exhibit high variance, you may be led into numerically unstable or otherwise undesirable regions of parameter space. \n",
    "One way to guard against this potential hazard is to pay close attention to parameters in your guide that control variance. \n",
    "For example we would generally expect this to be a reasonably initialized guide:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyro.distributions import constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "def good_guide():\n",
    "    scale = pyro.param(\"scale\", torch.tensor(0.05),               \n",
    "                       constraint=constraints.positive)\n",
    "    pyro.sample(\"x\", dist.Normal(0.0, scale))\n",
    "``` \n",
    "while the following high-variance guide is very likely to lead to problems:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def bad_guide():\n",
    "    scale = pyro.param(\"scale\", torch.tensor(12345.6),               \n",

    "    pyro.sample(\"x\", dist.Normal(0.0, scale))\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the initial variance of autoguides can be controlled with the `init_scale` argument, see e.g. [here](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/infer.autoguide.html?highlight=init_scale#autonormal) for `AutoNormal`."

    "### 8. Explore trade-offs controlled by `num_particles`, mini-batch size, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization can be difficult if your ELBO exhibits large variance. \n",
    "One way you can try to mitigate this issue is to increase the number of particles used to compute each stochastic ELBO estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "elbo = pyro.infer.Trace_ELBO(num_particles=10, \n",

    "```\n",
    "(Note that to use `vectorized_particles=True` you need to ensure your model and guide are properly vectorized; see the [tensor shapes tutorial](http://pyro.ai/examples/tensor_shapes.html) for best practices.)\n",
    "This results in lower variance gradients at the cost of more compute. \n",
    "If you are doing data subsampling, the mini-batch size offers a similar trade-off: larger mini-batch sizes reduce the variance at the cost of more compute. \n",
    "Although what's best is problem dependent, it's usually worth taking more gradient steps with fewer particles than fewer gradient steps with more particles. \n",
    "An important caveat to this is when you're running on a GPU, in which case (at least for some models) the cost of increasing `num_particles` or your mini-batch size may be sublinear, in which case increasing `num_particles` is likely more attractive.\n"

    "When analytic KL divergences are available, you may be able to lower ELBO variance by using analytic KL divergences instead.

    "### 10. Consider normalizing your ELBO\n",
    "\n",
    "By default Pyro computes a un-normalized ELBO, i.e. it computes the quantity that is a lower bound to the log evidence computed on the full set of data that is being conditioned on. \n",
    "For large datasets this can be a number of large magnitude. \n",
    "Since computers use finite precision (e.g. 32-bit floats) to do arithmetic, large numbers can be problematic for numerical stability, since they can lead to loss of precision, under/overflow, etc.\n",
    "For this reason it can be helpful in many cases to normalize your ELBO so that it is roughly order one. \n",
    "This can also be helpful for getting a rough feeling for how good your ELBO numbers are. \n",
    "For example if we have $N$ datapoints of dimension $D$ (e.g. $N$ real-valued vectors of dimension $D$) then we generally expect a reasonably well optimized ELBO to be order $N \\times D$. \n",
    "Thus if we renormalize our ELBO by a factor of $N \\times D$ we expect an ELBO of order one. \n",
    "While this is just a rough rule-of-thumb, if we use this kind of normalization and obtain ELBO values like $-123.4$ or $1234.5$ then something is probably wrong: perhaps our model is terribly mis-specified; perhaps our initialization is catastrophically bad, etc. \n",
