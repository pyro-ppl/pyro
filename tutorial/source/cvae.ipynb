    "# Conditional Variational Auto-encoder\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial implements [Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generati) paper, which introduced Conditional Variational Auto-encoders in 2015, using Pyro PPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied for many recognition problems in machine learning and computer vision. Although it can approximate a complex many-to-one function very well when large number of training data is provided, the lack of probabilistic inference of the current supervised deep learning methods makes it difficult to model a complex structured output representations. In this work, Kihyuk Sohn, Honglak Lee and Xinchen Yan develop a scalable deep conditional generative model for structured output variables using Gaussian latent variables. The model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, and allows a fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference. They called the model Conditional Variational Auto-encoder (CVAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CVAE is a conditional directed graphical model whose input observations modulate the prior on Gaussian latent variables that generate the outputs. It is trained to maximize the conditional marginal log-likelihood. The authors formulate the variational learning objective of the CVAE in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB). In experiments, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the CVAE in comparison to the deterministic neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic output predictions using stochastic inference. Here, we will implement their proof of concept: an artificial experimental setting for structured output prediction using MNIST database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem\n",
    "Let's divide each digit image into four quadrants, and take one, two, or three quadrant(s) as an input and the remaining quadrants as an output to be predicted. The image below shows the case where one quadrant is the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/x17xFwy/image1.png\" alt=\"image1\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to **learn a model that can perform probabilistic inference and make diverse predictions from a single input**. This is because we are not simply modeling a many-to-one function as in classification tasks, but we may need to model a mapping from single input to many possible outputs. One of the limitations of deterministic neural networks is that they generate only a single prediction. In the example above, the input shows a small part of a digit that might be a three or a five. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing the data\n",
    "We use the MNIST dataset; the first step is to prepare it. Depending on how many quadrants we will use as inputs, we will build the datasets and dataloaders, removing the unused pixels with -1:"

    "## Deep Conditional Generative Models for Structured Output Prediction\n",
    "As illustrated in the image below, there are three types of variables in a deep conditional generative model (CGM): input variables $\\bf x$, output variables $\\bf y$, and latent variables $\\bf z$. The conditional generative process of the model is given in (b) as follows: for given observation $\\bf x$, $\\bf z$ is drawn from the prior distribution $p_{\\theta}({\\bf z} | {\\bf x})$, and the output $\\bf y$ is generated from the distribution $p_{\\theta}({\\bf y} | {\\bf x, z})$. Compared to the baseline NN (a), the latent variables $\\bf z$ allow for modeling multiple modes in conditional distribution of output variables $\\bf y$ given input $\\bf x$, making the proposed CGM suitable for modeling one-to-many mapping.\n",

In designing the network architecture, we build the network components of the CVAE **on top of the baseline NN**.

We trained only for 50 epochs with early stopping patience of 3 epochs; to improve the results, we could leave the algorithm training for longer. Nevertheless, we can observe the same effect shown in the paper: **the estimated CLLs of the CVAE significantly outperforms the baseline NN**.\n",
