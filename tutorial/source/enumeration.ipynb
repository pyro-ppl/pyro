    "- Pyro implements automatic enumeration over discrete latent variables.\n",
    "- This strategy can be used alone or inside SVI (via [TraceEnum_ELBO](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/inference_algos.html#pyro.infer.traceenum_elbo.TraceEnum_ELBO)), HMC, or NUTS.\n",
    "- The standalone [infer_discrete](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/inference_algos.html#pyro.infer.discrete.infer_discrete) can generate samples or MAP estimates.\n",
    "- Annotate a sample site `infer={\"enumerate\": \"parallel\"}` to trigger enumeration.\n",
    "- If a sample site determines downstream structure, instead use `{\"enumerate\": \"sequential\"}`.\n",
    "- Write your models to allow arbitrarily deep batching on the left, e.g. use broadcasting.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pyro's enumeration strategy encompasses popular algorithms including variable elimination, exact message passing, forward-filter-backward-sample, inside-out, Baum-Welch, and many other special-case algorithms. Aside from enumeration, Pyro implements a number of inference strategies including variational inference ([SVI](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/inference_algos.html)) and monte carlo ([HMC](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/mcmc.html#pyro.infer.mcmc.HMC) and [NUTS](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/mcmc.html#pyro.infer.mcmc.NUTS)). Enumeration can be used either as a stand-alone strategy via [infer_discrete](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/inference_algos.html#pyro.infer.discrete.infer_discrete), or as a component of other strategies. Thus enumeration allows Pyro to marginalize out discrete latent variables in HMC and SVI models, and to use variational enumeration of discrete variables in SVI guides."

If you need more sample sites, you can annotate your model with  [pyro.markov](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/poutine.html#pyro.poutine.markov) to tell Pyro when it is safe to recycle tensor dimensions. Let's see how that works with the HMM model from above.
