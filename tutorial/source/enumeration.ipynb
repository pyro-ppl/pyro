    "Pyro's enumeration strategy encompasses popular algorithms including variable elimination, exact message passing, forward-filter-backward-sample, inside-out, Baum-Welch, and many other special-case algorithms. Aside from enumeration, Pyro implements a number of inference strategies including variational inference ([SVI](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/inference_algos.html)) and monte carlo ([HMC](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/mcmc.html#pyro.infer.mcmc.HMC) and [NUTS](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/mcmc.html#pyro.infer.mcmc.NUTS)). Enumeration can be used either as a stand-alone strategy via [infer_discrete](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/inference_algos.html#pyro.infer.discrete.infer_discrete), or as a component of other strategies. Thus enumeration allows Pyro to marginalize out discrete latent variables in HMC and SVI models, and to use variational enumeration of discrete variables in SVI guides."

    "PyTorch tensors have a dimension limit of 25 in CUDA and 64 in CPU. By default Pyro enumerates each sample site in a new dimension. If you need more sample sites, you can annotate your model with  [pyro.markov](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/poutine.html#pyro.poutine.markov) to tell Pyro when it is safe to recycle tensor dimensions. Let's see how that works with the HMM model from above. The only change we need is to annotate the for loop with `pyro.markov`, informing Pyro that the variables in each step of the loop depend only on variables outside of the loop and variables at this step and the previous step of the loop:\n",
