    "# Predicting the outcome of a US presidential election using Bayesian optimal experimental design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explore the use of optimal experimental design techniques to create an optimal polling strategy to predict the outcome of a US presidential election. In a [previous tutorial](http://pyro.ai/examples/working_memory.html), we explored the use of Bayesian optimal experimental design to learn the working memory capacity of a single person. Here, we apply the same concepts to study a whole country.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we need a Bayesian model of the winner of the election `w`, as well as the outcome `y` of any poll we may plan to conduct. The experimental design is the number of people $n_i$ to poll in each state. To set up our exploratory model, we are going to make a number of simplifying assumptions. We will use historical election data 1976-2012 to construct a plausible prior and the 2016 election as our test set: we imagine that we are conducting polling just before the 2016 election.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing a prior\n",
    "In our model, we include a 51 dimensional latent variabe `alpha`. For each of the 50 states plus DC we define \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_i = \\text{logit }\\mathbb{P}(\\text{a random voter in state } i \\text{ votes Democrat in the 2016 election}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we assume all other voters vote Republican. Right before the election, the value of $\\alpha$ is unknown and we wish to estimate it by conducting a poll with $n_i$ people in state $i$ for $i=1, ..., 51$ . The winner $w$ of the election is decided by the Electoral College system. The number of electoral college votes gained by the Democrats in state $i$ is\n",

    "0 \\text{ otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$(this is a rough approximation of the true system). All other electoral college votes go to the Republicans. Here $k_i$ is the number of electoral college votes alloted to state $i$, which are listed in the following data frame."

    "## Measuring the expected information gain of a polling strategy\n",
    "The prior we have set up appears to accord, at least approximately, with intuition. However, we now want to add a second source of information from polling. We aim to use our prior to select a polling strategy that will be most informative about our target $w$. A polling strategy, in this simplified set-up, is the number of people to poll in each state. (We ignore any other covariates such as regional variation inside states, demographics, etc.) We might imagine that polling 1000 people in Florida (the most marginal state), will be much more effective than polling 1000 people in DC (the least marginal state). That's because the outcome in DC is already quite predictable, just based on our prior, whereas the outcome in Florida is really up for grabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the information that our model will gain about $w$ based on conducting a poll with design $d$ and getting outcome $y$ can be described mathematically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{IG}(d, y) = KL(p(w|y,d)||p(w)).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the outcome of the poll is at present unknown, we consider the expected information gain [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{EIG}(d) = \\mathbb{E}_{p(y|d)}[KL(p(w|y,d)||p(w))].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variational estimators of EIG\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [working memory tutorial](http://pyro.ai/examples/working_memory.html), we used the 'marginal' estimator to find the EIG. This involved estimating the marginal density $p(y|d)$. In this experiment, that would be relatively difficult: $y$ is 51-dimensional with some rather tricky constraints that make modelling its density difficult. Furthermore, the marginal estimator requires us to know $p(y|w)$ analytically, which we do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, other variational estimators of EIG exist: see [2] for more details. One such variational estimator is the 'posterior' estimator, based on the following representation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{EIG}(d) = \\max_q \\mathbb{E}_{p(w, y|d)}\\left[\\log q(w|y) \\right] + H(p(w)).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $H(p(w))$ is the prior entropy on $w$ (we can compute this quite easily). The important term involves the variational approximation $q(w|y)$. This $q$ can be used to perform amortized variational inference. Specifically, it takes as input $y$ and outputs a distribution over $w$. The bound is maximised when $q(w|y) = p(w|y)$ [2]. Since $w$ is a binary random variable, we can think of $q$ as a classifier that tries to decide, based on the poll outcome, who the eventual winner of the election will be. In this notebook, $q$ will be a neural classifier. Training a neural classifier is a fair bit easier than learning the marginal density of $y$, so we adopt this method to estimate the EIG in this tutorial."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we showed how optimal experimental design principles can be applied to electoral polling. If we have the option of first designing the polling strategy using our prior, this can help lead to better predictions once we have collected our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model could be enhanced in a number of ways: a useful guide to the kinds of models used in political science can be found in [3]. Our optimal design strategy will only ever be as good as our prior, so there is certainly a lot of use in investing time in choosing a good prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might also be possible to search over the possible polling strategies in a more sophisticated way. For instance, simulated annealing [4] is one technique that can be used for optimization in high-dimensional discrete spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our polling strategies were chosen with one objective in mind: predict the final outcome $w$. If, on the other hand, we wanted to make more fine-grained predictions, we could use the same procedure but treat $\\alpha$ as our target instead of $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it's worth noting that there is a connection to Bayesian model selection: specifically, in a different model we might have $w$ a binary random variable to choose between different sub-models. Although conceptually different, our election set-up and the model selection set-up share many mathematical features which means that a similar experimental design approach could be used in both cases."
