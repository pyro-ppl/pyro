However, for non-primitive stochastic functions, we can no longer explicitly compute the marginal probability of an output $p(y \\; \\vert \\; x)$ or draw samples from the marginal distribution over return values $y \\sim p (y \\; \\vert \\; x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most general formulation, *inference* in a universal probabilistic programming language like Pyro is the problem of constructing this marginal distribution given an arbitrary boolean constraint so that we can perform these computations. The constraint can be a deterministic function of the return value, the internal randomness, or both.\n",

    "*Bayesian inference* or *posterior inference* is an important special case of this more general formulation that admits tractable approximations. In Bayesian inference, the return value is always the values of some subset internal `sample` statements, and the constraint is an equality constraint on the other internal `sample` statements.  Much of modern machine learning can be cast as approximate Bayesian inference and expressed succinctly in a language like Pyro.\n",
