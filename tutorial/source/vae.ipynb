    "# Variational Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The variational autoencoder (VAE) is arguably the simplest setup that realizes deep probabilistic modeling. Note that we're being careful in our choice of language here. The VAE isn't a model as such&mdash;rather the VAE is a particular setup for doing variational inference for a certain class of models. The class of models is quite broad: basically\n",
    "any (unsupervised) density estimator with latent random variables. The basic structure of such a model is simple, almost deceptively so (see Fig. 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure><img src=\"img/vae_model.png\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><figcaption> <font size=\"+1\"><b>Figure 1</b>: the class of deep models we're interested in; the joint probability density is given by $p_\\theta({\\bf x},{\\bf z})=p_\\theta({\\bf x}|{\\bf z}) p({\\bf z})$</font></figcaption></figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we've depicted the structure of the kind of model we're interested in as a graphical model. We have $N$ observed datapoints $\\{ \\bf x_i \\}$. Each datapoint is generated by a (local) latent random variable $\\bf z_i$. There is also a parameter $\\theta$, which is global in the sense that all the datapoints depend on it (which is why it's drawn outside the rectangle). Note that since $\\theta$ is a parameter, it's not something we're being Bayesian about. Finally, what's of particular importance here is that we allow for each $\\bf x_i$ to depend on $\\bf z_i$ in a complex, non-linear way. In practice this dependency will be parameterized by a (deep) neural network with parameters $\\theta$. It's this non-linearity that makes inference for this class of models particularly challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this non-linear structure is also one reason why this class of models offers a very flexible approach to modeling complex data. Indeed it's worth emphasizing that each of the components of the model can be 'reconfigured' in a variety of different ways. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the neural network in $p_\\theta({\\bf x} | {\\bf z})$ can be varied in all the usual ways (number of layers, type of non-linearities, number of hidden units, etc.)\n",
    "- we can choose observation likelihoods that suit the dataset at hand: gaussian, bernoulli, categorical, etc.\n",
    "- we can choose the number of dimensions in the latent space\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphical model representation is a useful way to think about the structure of the model, but it can also be fruitful to look at an explicit factorization of the joint probability density:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p({\\bf x}, {\\bf z}) = \\prod_{i=1}^N p_\\theta({\\bf x}_i | {\\bf z}_i) p({\\bf z}_i)  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that $p({\\bf x}, {\\bf z})$ breaks up into a product of terms like this makes it clear what me mean when we call $\\bf z_i$ a local random variable. For any particular $i$, only the single datapoint $\\bf x_i$ depends on $\\bf z_i$. As such the $\\{\\bf z_i\\}$ describe local structure, i.e. structure that is private to each data point. This factorized structure also means that we can do subsampling during the course of learning. As such this sort of model is amenable to the large data setting. (For more discussion on this and related topics see [SVI Part II](http://pyro.ai/examples/svi_part_ii.html).)\n",
    "\n",
    "So much for the model. Since the observations depend on the latent random variables in a complicated, non-linear way, we expect the posterior over the latents to have a complex structure. Consequently in order to do inference in this model we need to specify a flexibly family of guides (i.e. variational distributions). Since we want to be able to scale to large datasets, our guide is going to make use of amortization to keep the number of variational parameters under control (see [SVI Part II](http://pyro.ai/examples/svi_part_ii.html) for a somewhat more general discussion of amortization). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the job of the guide is to 'guess' good values for the latent random variables&mdash;good in the sense that they're true to the model prior _and_ true to the data. If we weren't making use of amortization, we would introduce variational parameters \n",
    "$\\{ \\lambda_i \\}$ for _each_ datapoint $\\bf x_i$. These variational parameters would represent our belief about 'good' values of $\\bf z_i$; for example, they could encode the mean and variance of a gaussian distribution in ${\\bf z}_i$ space. Amortization means that, rather than introducing variational parameters $\\{ \\lambda_i \\}$, we instead learn a _function_ that maps each $\\bf x_i$ to an appropriate $\\lambda_i$. Since we need this function to be flexible, we parameterize it as a neural network. We thus end up with a parameterized family of distributions over the latent $\\bf z$ space that can be instantiated for all $N$ datapoint ${\\bf x}_i$ (see Fig. 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure><img src=\"img/vae_guide.png\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><figcaption> <font size=\"+1\"><b>Figure 2</b>: a graphical representation of the guide $q_{\\phi}({\\bf z} | {\\bf x})$ </font></figcaption></figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the guide $q_{\\phi}({\\bf z} | {\\bf x})$ is parameterized by a global parameter $\\phi$ shared by all the datapoints. The goal of inference will be to find 'good' values for $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ so that two conditions are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the log evidence $\\log p_\\theta({\\bf x})$ is large. this means our model is a good fit to the data\n",
    "- the guide $q_{\\phi}({\\bf z} | {\\bf x})$ provides a good approximation to the posterior \n",
    "\n",
    "(For an introduction to stochastic variational inference see [SVI Part I](http://pyro.ai/examples/svi_part_i.html).)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we can zoom out and consider the high level structure of our setup. For concreteness, let's suppose the $\\{ \\bf x_i \\}$ are images so that the model is a generative model of images. Once we've learned a good value of $\\theta$ we can generate images from the model as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sample $\\bf z$ according to the prior $p({\\bf z})$\n",
    "- sample $\\bf x$ according to the likelihood $p_\\theta({\\bf x}|{\\bf z})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image is being represented by a latent code $\\bf z$ and that code gets mapped to images using the likelihood, which depends on the $\\theta$ we've learned. This is why the likelihood is often called the decoder in this context: its job is to decode $\\bf z$ into $\\bf x$. Note that since this is a probabilistic model, there is uncertainty about the $\\bf z$ that encodes a given datapoint $\\bf x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've learned good values for $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ we can also go through the following exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "- we start with a given image $\\bf x$\n",
    "- using our guide we encode it as $\\bf z$\n",
    "- using the model likelihood we decode $\\bf z$ and get a reconstructed image ${\\bf x}_\\rm{reco}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we've learned good values for $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, $\\bf x$ and ${\\bf x}_\\rm{reco}$ should be similar. This should clarify how the word autoencoder ended up being used to describe this setup: the model is the decoder and the guide is the encoder. Together, they can be thought of as an autoencoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VAE in Pyro\n",
    "\n",
    "So much for preliminaries. Let's see how we implement a VAE in Pyro.\n",
    "The dataset we're going to model is MNIST, a collection of images of handwritten digits.\n",
    "Since this is a popular benchmark dataset, we can make use of PyTorch's convenient data loader functionalities to reduce the amount of boilerplate code we need to write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "import torchvision.datasets as dset\n",
    "import torchvision.transforms as transforms\n",
    "\n",

    "    trans = transforms.ToTensor()\n",
    "    train_set = dset.MNIST(root=root, train=True, transform=trans,\n",

    "    return train_loader, test_loader\n",
    "```\n",
    "The main thing to draw attention to here is that we use `transforms.ToTensor()` to normalize the pixel intensities to the range $[0.0, 1.0]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we define a PyTorch module that encapsulates our decoder network:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Decoder(nn.Module):\n",

    "$28\\times28=784$, `mu_img` and `sigma_img` are each of size `batch_size` x 784.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an image $\\bf x$ the forward call of `Encoder` returns a mean and covariance that together parameterize a distribution in latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our encoder and decoder networks in hand, we can now write down the stochastic functions that represent our model and guide. First the model: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def model(self, x): \n",
    "    # register PyTorch module `decoder` with Pyro\n",

    "                 x.view(-1, 784))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `model()` is a callable that takes in a mini-batch of images `x` as input. This is a PyTorch `Variable` of size `batch_size` x 784.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we do inside of `model()` is register the (previously instantiated) decoder module with Pyro. Note that we give it an appropriate (and unique) name. This call to `pyro.module` lets Pyro know about all the parameters inside of the decoder network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we setup the hyperparameters for our prior, which is just a unit normal gaussian distribution. Note that\n",
    "- we use the helper functions `ng_zeros` and `ng_ones`, which return PyTorch `Variable`s with `requires_grad=False`. these hyperparemeters are fixed and should not be trained!\n",
    "- since we're processing an entire mini-batch of images, we need the leftmost dimension of `z_mu` and `z_sigma` to equal the mini-batch size\n",
    "- in case we're on GPU, we use `type_as` to make sure `z_mu` and `z_sigma` are CUDA Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we sample the latent `z` from the prior, making sure to give the random variable a unique Pyro name `'latent'`. \n",
    "Then we pass `z` through the decoder network, which returns `mu_img` and `sigma_img`. We then score the observed images in the mini-batch `x` against the gaussian likelihood. \n",
    "Note that we flatten `x` so that all the pixels are in the rightmost dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all there is to it! Note how closely the flow of Pyro primitives in `model` follows the generative story of our model, e.g. as encapsulated by Figure 1. Now we move on to the guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def guide(self, x): \n",
    "    # register PyTorch module `encoder` with Pyro\n",
    "    pyro.module(\"encoder\", self.encoder)\n",
    "    # use the encoder to get the parameters used to define q(z|x)\n",
    "    z_mu, z_sigma = self.encoder(x)\n",
    "    # sample the latent code z\n",
    "    pyro.sample(\"latent\", dist.normal, z_mu, z_sigma)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in the model, we first register the PyTorch module we're using (namely `encoder`) with Pyro. Then we take the mini-batch of images `x` and pass it through the encoder. Then using the parameters output by the encoder network we use the normal distribution to sample a value of the latent for each image in the mini-batch. Crucially, we use the same name for the latent random variable as we did in the model: `'latent'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've defined the full model and guide we can move on to inference. But before we do so let's see how we package the model and guide in a PyTorch module:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class VAE(nn.Module):\n",
    "    # by default our latent space is 20-dimensional\n",

    "        super(VAE, self).__init__()\n",
    "        # create the encoder and decoder networks\n",
    "        self.encoder = Encoder(z_dim, hidden_dim)\n",

    "        \n",
    "    def guide(self, x):\n",
    "        # ... as above...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The point we'd like to make here is that the two `Module`s `encoder` and `decoder` are attributes of `VAE` (which itself inherits from `nn.Module`). This has the consequence they are both automatically registered as belonging to the `VAE` module. So, for example, when we call `parameters()` on an instance of `VAE`, PyTorch will know to return all the relevant parameters. It also means that if we're running on a GPU, the call to `cuda()` will move all the parameters of all the (sub)modules into GPU memory."
