The VAE isn't a model as such&mdash;rather the VAE is a particular setup for doing variational inference for a certain class of models. The class of models is quite broad: basically\n",

    "Here we've depicted the structure of the kind of model we're interested in as a graphical model. We have $N$ observed datapoints $\\{ \\bf x_i \\}$. Each datapoint is generated by a (local) latent random variable $\\bf z_i$. There is also a parameter $\\theta$, which is global in the sense that all the datapoints depend on it (which is why it's drawn outside the rectangle). Note that since $\\theta$ is a parameter, it's not something we're being Bayesian about. Finally, what's of particular importance here is that we allow for each $\\bf x_i$ to depend on $\\bf z_i$ in a complex, non-linear way. In practice this dependency will be parameterized by a (deep) neural network with parameters $\\theta$. It's this non-linearity that makes inference for this class of models particularly challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this non-linear structure is also one reason why this class of models offers a very flexible approach to modeling complex data. Indeed it's worth emphasizing that each of the components of the model can be 'reconfigured' in a variety of different ways. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the neural network in $p_\\theta({\\bf x} | {\\bf z})$ can be varied in all the usual ways (number of layers, type of non-linearities, number of hidden units, etc.)\n",
    "- we can choose observation likelihoods that suit the dataset at hand: gaussian, bernoulli, categorical, etc.\n",
    "- we can choose the number of dimensions in the latent space\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphical model representation is a useful way to think about the structure of the model, but it can also be fruitful to look at an explicit factorization of the joint probability density:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p({\\bf x}, {\\bf z}) = \\prod_{i=1}^N p_\\theta({\\bf x}_i | {\\bf z}_i) p({\\bf z}_i)  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that $p({\\bf x}, {\\bf z})$ breaks up into a product of terms like this makes it clear what me mean when we call $\\bf z_i$ a local random variable. For any particular $i$, only the single datapoint $\\bf x_i$ depends on $\\bf z_i$. As such the $\\{\\bf z_i\\}$ describe local structure, i.e. structure that is private to each data point. This factorized structure also means that we can do subsampling during the course of learning. As such this sort of model is amenable to the large data setting. (For more discussion on this and related topics see [SVI Part II](svi_part_ii.ipynb).)\n",
    "\n",
    "So much for the model. Since the observations depend on the latent random variables in a complicated, non-linear way, we expect the posterior over the latents to have a complex structure. Consequently in order to do inference in this model we need to specify a flexibly family of guides (i.e. variational distributions). Since we want to be able to scale to large datasets, our guide is going to make use of amortization to keep the number of variational parameters under control (see [SVI Part II](svi_part_ii.ipynb) for a somewhat more general discussion of amortization). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the job of the guide is to 'guess' good values for the latent random variables&mdash;good in the sense that they're true to the model prior _and_ true to the data. If we weren't making use of amortization, we would introduce variational parameters \n",
    "$\\{ \\lambda_i \\}$ for _each_ datapoint $\\bf x_i$. These variational parameters would represent our belief about 'good' values of $\\bf z_i$; for example, they could encode the mean and variance of a gaussian distribution in ${\\bf z}_i$ space. Amortization means that, rather than introducing variational parameters $\\{ \\lambda_i \\}$, we instead learn a _function_ that maps each $\\bf x_i$ to an appropriate $\\lambda_i$. Since we need this function to be flexible, we parameterize it as a neural network. We thus end up with a parameterized family of distributions over the latent $\\bf z$ space that can be instantiated for all $N$ datapoint ${\\bf x}_i$ (see Fig. 2)."

We take an image and pass it through the encoder. Then we sample in latent space using the gaussian distribution provided by the encoder. Finally we decode the latent code into an image: we return the mean vector `loc_img` instead of sampling with it. Note that since the `sample()` statement is stochastic, we'll get different draws of z every time we run the reconstruct_img function. If we've learned a good model and guide—in particular if we've learned a good latent representation—this plurality of z samples will correspond to different styles of digit writing, and the reconstructed images should exhibit an interesting variety of different styles."
