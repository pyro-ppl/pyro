    "# Deep Markov Model \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to build a deep probabilistic model for sequential data: the deep markov model. The particular dataset we want to model is composed of snippets of polyphonic music. Each time slice in a sequence spans a quarter note and is represented by an 88-dimensional binary vector that encodes the notes at that time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since music is (obviously) temporally coherent, we need a model that can represent complex time dependencies in the observed data. It would not, for example, be appropriate to consider a model in which the notes at a particular time step are independent of the notes at previous time steps. One way to do this is to build a latent variable model in which the variability and temporal structure of the observations is controlled by the dynamics of the latent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "One particular realization of this idea is a markov model, in which we have a chain of latent variables, with each latent variable in the chain conditioned on the previous latent variable. This is a powerful approach, but if we want to represent complex data with complex (and in this case unknown) dynamics, we would like our model to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate dynamics that are potentially highly non-linear. Thus a deep markov model: we allow for the transition probabilities governing the dynamics of the latent variables as well as the the emission probabilities that govern how the observations are generated by the latent dynamics to be parameterized by (non-linear) neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific model we're going to implement is based on the following reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] `Structured Inference Networks for Nonlinear State Space Models`,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "    Rahul G. Krishnan, Uri Shalit, David Sontag\n",
    "    \n",
    "Please note that while we do not assume that the reader of this tutorial has read the reference, it's definitely a good place to look for a more comprehensive discussion of the deep markov model in  the context of other time series models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've described the model, but how do we go about training it? The inference strategy we're going to use is variational inference, which requires specifying a parameterized family of distributions that can be used to approximate the posterior distribution over the latent random variables. Given the non-linearities and complex time-dependencies inherent in our model and data, we expect the exact posterior to be highly non-trivial. So we're going to need a flexible family of variational distributions if we hope to learn a good model. Happily, together PyTorch and Pyro provide all the necessary ingredients. As we will see, assembling them will be straightforward. Let's get to work."

We can also read off the markov property of the model: each latent ${\\bf z}_t$, when conditioned on the previous latent ${\\bf z}_{t-1}$, is independent of all previous latents $\\{ {\\bf z}_{t-2}, {\\bf z}_{t-3}, ...\\}$.

For the probability distributions $p({\\bf z}_t|{\\bf z}_{t-1})$ that control the latent dynamics, we choose (conditional) gaussian distributions with diagonal covariances.

Note that the black squares appear in two different places: in between pairs of latents and in between latents and observations.

Since we allow the conditional probability distribution of ${\\bf z}_{t}$ to depend on ${\\bf z}_{t-1}$ in a complex way, we will be able to capture complex dynamics in our model. Similarly, the non-linear function that connects the latent variables to the observations ('Emit' in Fig. 1) controls how the observations depend on the latent dynamics. \n",

    "This mirrors the structure of `Emitter` above, with the difference that the computational flow is a bit more complicated. This is for two reasons. First, the output of `GatedTransition` needs to define a valid (diagonal) gaussian distribution. So we need to output two parameters: the mean `loc`, and the (square root) covariance `scale`. These both need to have the same dimension as the latent space. Second, we don't want to _force_ the dynamics to be non-linear. Thus our mean `loc` is a sum of two terms, only one of which depends non-linearily on the input `z_t_1`. This way we can support both linear and non-linear dynamics (or indeed have the dynamics of part of the latent space be linear, while the remainder of the dynamics is non-linear). "

The `sample` statements will be used to specify the joint distribution over the latents ${\\bf z}_{1:T}$. Additionally, the `obs` argument can be used with the `sample` statements to specify how the observations ${\\bf x}_{1:T}$ depend on the latents.

For now let's just take a look at `mini_batch` and `mini_batch_mask`. `mini_batch` is a three dimensional tensor, with the first dimension being the batch dimension, the second dimension being the temporal dimension, and the final dimension being the features (88-dimensional in our case). To speed up the code, whenever we run `model` we're going to process an entire mini-batch of sequences (i.e. we're going to take advantage of vectorization). \n",

Even for small $N$ this is a very high-dimensional distribution that will require a very large number of parameters to specify. In particular if we were to directly parameterize the posterior in this form, the number of parameters required would grow (at least) linearly with $N$. One way to avoid this nasty growth with the size of the dataset is *amortization* (see the analogous discussion in [SVI Part II](svi_part_ii.ipynb)).\n",

    "This works as follows. Instead of introducing variational parameters for each sequence in our dataset, we're going to learn a single parametric function $f({\\bf x}_{1:T})$ and work with a variational distribution that has the form $\\prod_{n=1}^N q({\\bf z}_{1:T_n}^n | f({\\bf x}_{1:T_n}^n))$. The function $f(\\cdot)$&mdash;which basically maps a given observed sequence to a set of variational parameters tailored to that sequence&mdash;will need to be sufficiently rich to capture the posterior accurately, but now we can handle large datasets without having to introduce an obscene number of variational parameters.\n",

    "So our task is to construct the function $f(\\cdot)$. Since in our case we need to support variable-length sequences, it's only natural that $f(\\cdot)$ have a RNN in the loop.

Next, each of the hidden states will be fed into a `Combiner` module whose job is to output the mean and covariance of the the conditional distribution $q({\\bf z}_t | {\\bf z}_{t-1}, {\\bf x}_{t:T})$, which we take to be given by a diagonal gaussian distribution. (Just like in the model, the conditional structure of ${\\bf z}_{1:T}$ in the guide is such that we sample ${\\bf z}_t$ forward in time.) In addition to the RNN hidden state, the `Combiner` also takes the latent random variable from the previous time step as input, except for $t=1$, where it instead takes the trainable (variational) parameter ${\\bf z}_0^{\\rm{q}}$. \n",

In brief, while we could, for example, condition on the entire sequence of observations, because of the markov structure of the model everything that we need to know about the previous observations ${\\bf x}_{1:t-1}$ is encapsulated by ${\\bf z}_{t-1}$.

Also, the `for` loop has the same structure as the one in `model()`, with the difference that the guide only needs to sample latents (there are no `sample` statements with the `obs` keyword).

Note that because we want the RNN to consume the observations from right to left, the input to the RNN is `mini_batch_reversed`, which is a copy of `mini_batch` with all the sequences running in _reverse_ temporal order. Furthermore, `mini_batch_reversed` has been wrapped in a PyTorch `rnn.pack_padded_sequence` so that the RNN can deal with variable-length sequences.

    "## The Black Magic of Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, before we get to the guts of training, let's take a moment and think a bit about the optimization problem we've setup. We've traded Bayesian inference in a non-linear model with a high-dimensional latent space&mdash;a hard problem&mdash;for a particular optimization problem. Let's not kid ourselves, this optimization problem is pretty hard too. Why? Let's go through some of the reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the space of parameters we're optimizing over is very high-dimensional (it includes all the weights in all the neural networks we've defined).\n",
    "- our objective function (the ELBO) cannot be computed analytically. so our parameter updates will be following noisy Monte Carlo gradient estimates\n",
    "- data-subsampling serves as an additional source of stochasticity: even if we wanted to, we couldn't in general take gradient steps on the ELBO defined over the whole dataset (actually in our particular case the dataset isn't so large, but let's ignore that).\n",
    "- given all the neural networks and non-linearities we have in the loop, our (stochastic) loss surface is highly non-trivial\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot is that if we're going to find reasonable (local) optima of the ELBO, we better take some care in deciding how to do optimization. This isn't the time or place to discuss all the different strategies that one might adopt, but it's important to emphasize how decisive a good or bad choice in learning hyperparameters (the learning rate, the mini-batch size, etc.) can be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on, let's discuss one particular optimization strategy that we're making use of in greater detail: KL annealing. In our case the ELBO is the sum of two terms: an expected log likelihood term (which measures model fit) and a sum of KL divergence terms (which serve to regularize the approximate posterior):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rm{ELBO} = \\mathbb{E}_{q({\\bf z}_{1:T})}[\\log p({\\bf x}_{1:T}|{\\bf z}_{1:T})] -  \\mathbb{E}_{q({\\bf z}_{1:T})}[ \\log q({\\bf z}_{1:T}) - \\log p({\\bf z}_{1:T})]$\n",
    "\n",
    "This latter term can be a quite strong regularizer, and in early stages of training it has a tendency to favor regions of the loss surface that contain lots of bad local optima. One strategy to avoid these bad local optima, which was also adopted in reference [1], is to anneal the KL divergence terms by multiplying them by a scalar `annealing_factor` that ranges between zero and one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{E}_{q({\\bf z}_{1:T})}[\\log p({\\bf x}_{1:T}|{\\bf z}_{1:T})] -  \\rm{annealing\\_factor} \\times \\mathbb{E}_{q({\\bf z}_{1:T})}[ \\log q({\\bf z}_{1:T}) - \\log p({\\bf z}_{1:T})]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that during the course of training the  `annealing_factor` rises slowly from its initial value at/near zero to its final value at 1.0. The annealing schedule is arbitrary; below we will use a simple linear schedule. In terms of code, to scale the log likelihoods by the appropriate annealing factor we enclose each of the latent sample statements in the model and guide with a `pyro.poutine.scale` context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we should mention that the main difference between the DMM implementation described here and the one used in reference [1] is that they take advantage of the analytic formula for the KL divergence between two gaussian distributions (whereas we rely on Monte Carlo estimates). This leads to lower variance gradient estimates of the ELBO, which makes training a bit easier. We can still train the model without making this analytic substitution, but training probably takes somewhat longer because of the higher variance. Support for analytic KL divergences in Pyro is something we plan to add in the future."

The reason is that additional stochasticity due to data-subsampling is often advantageous during optimization: in particular it can help us avoid local optima._]  And, in fact, in order to get a lessy noisy estimate of the ELBO, we're going to compute a multi-sample estimate.

For the same dataset and a similar model/guide setup (dimension of the latent space, number of hidden units in the RNN, etc.) they report a normalized negative log likelihood (NLL) of `6.93` on the testset (lower is better$)^{\\S}$. This is to be compared to our result of `6.87`. These numbers are very much in the same ball park, which is reassuring. It seems that, at least for this dataset, not using analytic expressions for the KL divergences doesn't degrade the quality of the learned model (although, as discussed above, the training probably takes somewhat longer)."

In the case that we have `AffineAutoregressive`'s in the loop, this is in fact the only option at our disposal. This is because the `AffineAutoregressive` module contains what are called 'persistent buffers' in PyTorch parlance. These are things that carry state but are not `Parameter`s. The `state_dict()` and `load_state_dict()` methods of `nn.Module` know how to deal with buffers correctly.\n",
