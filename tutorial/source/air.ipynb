    "#### Aside: Vectorized mini-batches\n",
    "\n",
    "In our final implementation we would like to generate a mini batch of samples in parallel for efficiency. While Pyro supports vectorized mini batches with `iarange`, it currently requires that each `sample` statement within `iarange` makes a choice for all samples in the mini batch. Another way to say this is that each sample in the mini batch will encounter the same set of `sample` statements. This is problematic for us, because as we've just seen, samples can make differing numbers of choices under our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way around this is to have all samples take the same number of steps, but to nullify (so far as is possible) the effect of the superfuous random choices made after the sample is conceptually \"complete\". We'll say that a sample is \"complete\" once a zero is sampled from the Bernoulli random choice, and prior to that we'll say that a sample is \"active\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this is straight forward. Following [1] we choose to take a fixed number of steps for each sample. (By doing so we no longer specify a geometric distribution over the number of steps, since the number of steps is now bounded. It would be interesting to explore the alternative of having each sample in the batch take steps until a successful Bernoulli trial has occured in each, as this would retain the geometric prior.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the second part we will take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only add objects to the output while a sample is active.\n",
    "2. Use `poutine.scale` to set the log probability of random choices made by complete samples to zero. (Since the [SVI loss](svi_part_iii.html) is a weighted sum of log probabilities, setting a choice's log probability to zero effectively removes its contribution to the loss.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Looking ahead, we'll need to take similar measures when we implement the guide and add baselines later in this tutorial.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, one thing we can't undo is the work done in performing unncessary sampling. Nevertheless, even though this approach performs redundant computation, the gains from using mini batches are so large that this is still a win overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an updated model step function that implements these ideas. In summary, the changes from `prior_step_sketch` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We've added a new parameter `n` that specifies the size of the mini batch.\n",
    "2. We now conditionally add the object to the output image based on a value sampled from a Bernoulli distribution.\n",

Recall that the guide will output information about an object's pose and its latent code at each step. The improvement we can make is based on the observation that once we have inferred the pose of an object, we can do a better job of inferring its latent code if we use the pose information to crop the object from the input image, and pass the result (which we'll call a \"window\") through an additional network in order to compute the parameters of the latent code.

    "## Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the introduction, successfully performing inference in this model is a challenge. In particular, the presence of discrete choices in the model makes inference trickier than in a model in which all choices can be reparameterized. The underlying problem we face is that the gradient estimates we use in the optimization performed by variational inference have much higher variance in the presence of [non-reparameterizable choices](svi_part_iii.html#Tricky-Case:-Non-reparameterizable-Random-Variables).\n",

    "Happily for us, Pyro includes support for data dependent baselines. If you are not already familiar with this idea, you might want to read [our introduction](svi_part_iii.html#Baselines-in-Pyro) before continuing. As model authors we only have to implement the neural network, pass it our data as input, and feed its output to `pyro.sample`. Pyro's inference back-end will ensure that the baseline is included in the gradient estimator used for inference, and that the network parameters are updated appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can add data dependent baselines to our AIR implementation. We need a neural network that can output a (scalar) baseline value at each discrete choice in the guide, having received a multi-mnist image and the values sampled by the guide so far as input. Notice that this is very similar to the structure of the guide network, and indeed we will again use a recurrent network.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we `detach` values sampled by the guide before passing them to the baseline network. This is important as the baseline network and the guide network are entirely separate networks optimized with different objectives. Without this, gradients would flow from the baseline network into the guide network. When using data dependent baselines we must do this whenever we feed values sampled by the guide into the baselines network. (If we don't we'll trigger a PyTorch run-time error.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we multiply the output of the baseline network by the value of `z_pres` from the previous step. This relieves the baseline network from the burdon of having to output accurate predictions for completed samples. (The outputs for completed samples will be multiplied by zero, so the derivative of the [baseline loss](svi_part_iii.html#Neural-Baselines) for these outputs will be zero.) It's OK to do this because in effect we've already removed random choices for completed samples from the inference objective, so there's no need to apply any variance reduction to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have everything we need to complete the implementation of the guide. Our final `guide_step` function will be very similar to `guide_step_improved` introduced above. The only changes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We now call the `baseline_step` helper and pass the baseline value it returns to `pyro.sample`.\n",
    "2. We've added `poutine.scale` contexts. These serve exactly the same purpose as the masks added to the model. (See the earlier discussion for the motivation behind this change.)\n",
    "\n",

    "* Inference is unlikely to recover correct object counts unless a small prior success probability for `z_pres` is used. In [1] this [probability was annealed](http://akosiorek.github.io/ml/2017/09/03/implementing-air.html) from a value close to one to `1e-5` (or less) during optimization, though we found that a fixed value of around `0.01` worked well with our implementation.\n",
    "* We initialize the decoder network to generate mostly empty objects initially. (Using the `--decoder-output-bias` argument.) This encourages the guide to explore the use of objects to explain the input early in optimization. Without this each object is a mid-gray square which is heavily penalized by the likelihood, prompting the guide to turn most steps off.\n",
    "* It is reported to be useful in practice to use a different learning rate for the baseline network. This is straight forward to implement in Pyro by tagging modules associated with the baseline network and passing multiple learning rates to the optimizer. (See the section on [optimizers](svi_part_i.html#Optimizers) in part I of the SVI tutorial for more detail.) In [1] a learning rate of `1e-4` was used for the guide network, and a learning rate of `1e-3` was used for the baseline network. We found it necessary to use a larger learning rate for the baseline network in order to make progress on count accuracy at a similar rate to [1]. This difference is likely caused by Pyro setting up a [slightly different baseline loss](https://github.com/uber/pyro/issues/555).\n",
