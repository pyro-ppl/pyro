    "The semi-supervised setting represents an interesting intermediate case where some of the data is labeled and some is not. It is also of great practical importance, since we often have very little labeled data and much more unlabeled data. We'd clearly like to leverage unlabeled data to improve our models of the labeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The semi-supervised setting is also well suited to generative models, where missing data can be accounted for quite naturally&mdash;at least conceptually.\n",
    "As we will see, in restricting our attention to semi-supervised generative models, there will be no shortage of different model variants and possible inference strategies. \n",
    "Although we'll only be able to explore a few of these variants in detail, the reader is likely to come away from the tutorial with a greater appreciation for the abstractions and modularity offered by probabilistic programming.\n",

    "So let's go about building a generative model. We have a dataset \n",

Even with this set of choices, a number of model variants are possible: we're going to focus on the model variant depicted in Figure 1 (this is model M2 in reference [1])."

In this model setup, the latent random variable ${\\bf z}_i$ and the (partially observed) digit label _jointly_ generate the observed image.\n",

As discussed in [SVI Part III](http://pyro.ai/examples/svi_part_i.html) this will generally lead to high-variance gradient estimates. \n",
    "- A common way to ameliorate this problem&mdash;and one we'll explore below&mdash;is to forego sampling and instead sum out all ten values of the class label ${\\bf y}_i$ when we calculate the ELBO for an unlabeled datapoint ${\\bf x}_i$. This is more expensive per step, but can help us reduce the variance of our gradient estimator and thereby take fewer steps\n",
    "- Recall that the role of the guide is to 'fill in' _latent_ random variables. Concretely, one component of our guide will be a digit classifier $q_\\phi({\\bf y} | {\\bf x})$ that will randomly 'fill in' labels $\\{ {\\bf y}_i \\}$ given an image $\\{ {\\bf x}_i \\}$. Crucially, this means that the only term in the ELBO that will depend on $q_\\phi(\\cdot | {\\bf x})$ is the term that involves a sum over _unlabeled_ datapoints. This means that our classifier $q_\\phi(\\cdot | {\\bf x})$&mdash;which in many cases will be the primary object of interest&mdash;will not be learning from the labeled datapoints (at least not directly)\n",
    "- This seems like a potential problem. Luckily, various fixes are possible. Below we'll follow the approach in reference [1], which involves introducing an additional objective function for the classifier to ensure that the classifier learns directly from the labeled data\n",

For example, if we have 1,000 labeled images and 49,000 unlabeled ones, then we'll take 49 steps with unlabeled mini-batches for each labeled mini-batch.

    "## Interlude: Summing Out Discrete Latents\n",
    "\n",
    "As highlighted in the introduction, when the discrete latent labels ${\\bf y}$ are not observed, the ELBO gradient estimates rely on sampling from $q_\\phi({\\bf y}|{\\bf x})$. These gradient estimates can be very high-variance, especially early in the learning process when the guessed labels are often incorrect. A common approach to reduce variance in this case is to sum out discrete latent variables, replacing the Monte Carlo expectation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb E_{{\\bf y}\\sim q_\\phi(\\cdot|{\\bf x})}\\nabla\\operatorname{ELBO}$$\n",

    "```python\n",
    "svi = SVI(model, guide, optim, loss=\"ELBO\", enum_discrete=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this mode of operation, each `svi.step(...)` computes a gradient term for each of the ten latent states of $y$. Although each step is thus $10\\times$ more expensive, we'll see that the lower-variance gradient estimate outweighs the additional cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going beyond the particular model in this tutorial, Pyro supports summing over arbitrarily many discrete latent variables. Beware that the cost of summing is exponential in the number of discrete variables, but is cheap(er) if multiple independent discrete variables are packed into a single tensor (as in this tutorial, where the discrete labels for the entire mini-batch are packed into the single tensor ${\\bf y}$). To use this parallel form of `enum_discrete`, we must inform Pyro that the items in a minibatch are indeed independent by wrapping our vectorized code in a `with iarange(\"name\")` block."

First, as we can see from Figure 3, the test and validation accuracies now evolve much more smoothly over the course of training. More importantly, this single modification improved test accuracy from around `20%` to about `90%` for the case of $3000$ labeled examples. See Table 1 for the full results.

For comparison, we also show results from a simple classifier baseline, which only makes use of the supervised data (and no latent random variables). Reported are mean accuracies (with 95% confidence bounds in parentheses) across five random selections of supervised data.\n",

    "We first note that the results for the third variant&mdash;where we summed out the discrete latent random variable $\\bf y$ and made use of the additional term in the objective function&mdash;reproduce the results reported in reference [1]. This is encouraging, since it means that the abstractions in Pyro proved flexible enough to accomodate the required modeling and inference setup. Significantly, this flexibility was evidently necessary to outperform the baseline. It's also worth emphasizing that the gap between the baseline and third variant of our generative model setup increases as the number of labeled datapoints decreases (maxing out at about 15% for the case with only 100 labeled datapoints). This is a tantalizing result because it's precisely in the regime where we have few labeled data points that semi-supervised learning is particularly attractive."

Note that the structure of the embedding is quite different than that in the [VAE](http://pyro.ai/examples/vae.html) case, where the digits are clearly separated from one another in the embedding. This make sense, since for the semi-supervised case the latent $\\bf z$ is free to use its representational capacity to model, e.g., handwriting style, since the variation between digits is provided by the (partially observed) labels."

    "We've seen that generative models offer a natural approach to semi-supervised machine learning. One of the most attractive features of generative models is that we can explore a large variety of models in a single unified setting. In this tutorial we've only been able to explore a small fraction of the possible model and inference setups that are possible. There is no reason to expect that one variant is best; depending on the dataset and application, there will be reason to prefer one over another. And there a lot of variants (see Figure 7)!"
