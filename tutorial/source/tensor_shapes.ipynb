This is analogous to d-separation in graphical models: it is always safe to add edges and assume variables *may* be dependent (i.e. to widen the model class), but it is unsafe to assume independence when variables are actually dependent (i.e. narrowing the model class so the true model lies outside of the class, as in mean field).

An example of an independent dimension is the index over data in a minibatch: each datum should be independent of all others.\n",

This code can be simplified by using [poutine.broadcast](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/poutine.html#pyro.poutine.broadcast), which automatically broadcasts the batch shape of `pyro.sample` statements when inside a single or nested iarange context. \n",

Modularizing the model code into components is a common practice, and helps with maintainability of large models. The first sampling function is identical to what we had in `model4`, and the remaining sampling functions use `poutine.broadcast` to implicitly expand sample sites to confirm to the shape requirements imposed by the `iarange` contexts in which they are embedded.\n",
    " - We would also like to use the `pyro.iarange` construct to parallelize the ELBO estimator over [num_particles](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/inference_algos.html#pyro.infer.elbo.ELBO). This is done by wrapping the contents of model/guide inside an outermost `pyro.iarange` context."
