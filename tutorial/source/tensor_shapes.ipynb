    "- While you are learning or debugging, set `pyro.enable_validation(True)`.\n",
    "- Tensors broadcast by aligning on the right: `torch.ones(3,4,5) + torch.ones(5)`.\n",
    "- Distribution `.sample().shape == batch_shape + event_shape`.\n",
    "- Distribution `.log_prob(x).shape == batch_shape` (but not `event_shape`!).\n",
    "- Use `.expand()` to draw a batch of samples, or rely on `plate` to expand automatically.\n",
    "- Use `my_dist.to_event(1)` to declare a dimension as dependent.\n",
    "- Use `with pyro.plate('name', size):` to declare a dimension as conditionally independent.\n",
    "- All dimensions must be declared either dependent or conditionally independent.\n",
    "- Try to support batching on the left. This lets Pyro auto-parallelize.\n",
    "  - use negative indices like `x.sum(-1)` rather than `x.sum(2)`\n",
    "  - use ellipsis notation like `pixel = image[..., i, j]`\n",
    "  - use [Vindex](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/ops.html#pyro.ops.indexing.Vindex) if `i,j` are enumerated, `pixel = Vindex(image)[..., i, j]`\n",
    "- When debugging, examine all shapes in a trace using [Trace.format_shapes()](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/poutine.html#pyro.poutine.Trace.format_shapes).\n",

This is analogous to d-separation in graphical models: it is always safe to add edges and assume variables *may* be dependent (i.e. to widen the model class), but it is unsafe to assume independence when variables are actually dependent (i.e. narrowing the model class so the true model lies outside of the class, as in mean field). In practice Pyro's SVI inference algorithm uses reparameterized gradient estimators for `Normal` distributions so both gradient estimators have the same performance."

    "In the first sampling function, we had to do some manual book-keeping and expand the `Bernoulli` distribution's batch shape to account for the conditionally independent dimensions added by the `pyro.plate` contexts. In particular, note how `sample_pixel_locations` needs knowledge of `num_particles`, `width` and `height` and is accessing these variables from the global scope, which is not ideal. \n",

    " - The second argument to `pyro.plate`, i.e. the optional `size` argument needs to be provided for implicit broadasting, so that it can infer the batch shape requirement for each of the sample sites. \n",
    " - The existing `batch_shape` of the sample site must be broadcastable with the size of the `pyro.plate` contexts. In our particular example, `Bernoulli(p_x)` has an empty batch shape which is universally broadcastable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how simple it is to achieve parallelization via tensorized operations using `pyro.plate`! `pyro.plate` also helps in code modularization because model components can be written agnostic of the `plate` contexts in which they may subsequently get embedded in."
